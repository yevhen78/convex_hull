# convex_hull

This is a python application that builds a convex hull around a random normally distributed set of points. 
It was done as an exercise for the coursera algorithms course from Princeton, and as an introduction to heroku. 
You can check it out hosted on heroku [here](http://young-badlands-7015.herokuapp.com).
